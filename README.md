Authors: Alicia Bayerl, Rosanna Beckmann, Tim Kapferer, Michael Ramich, Hendrik Schmidt, Maximilian Springer

This is Group Two's project for the course Neurodynamics hold at the University of Osnabr√ºck in the summer term 2022. <br>

We developed an artificial neural network to predict flooding events in the city of Hamburg, using weather data and the water level (Elbe) of the past. <br>
